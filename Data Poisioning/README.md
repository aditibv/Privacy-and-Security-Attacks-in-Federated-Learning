## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Other required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Preprocessing

Before running any attacks, you need to preprocess the dataset.

1. **Run the preprocessing script:**

    ```bash
    python preprocessing.py
    ```

    This script processes the raw data and saves the preprocessed dataset for use in the subsequent steps.

## Running Attacks

After preprocessing, you can run each attack using the following scripts:

1. **Client-Side Script:**
   - `client.py`: This script simulates the client-side operations, including training local models and sending updates to the server.

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

2. **Server-Side Script:**
   - `server.py`: This script handles the server-side operations, including aggregating updates from clients and managing the global model.

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

3. **Main Script:**
   - `main.py`: This script orchestrates the overall execution, including setting up the federated learning environment and running attacks.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Data Loader:**
   - `dataloader.py`: This script handles loading and splitting the dataset into local subsets for federated learning.

    ```bash
    python dataloader.py
    ```

5. **Neural Network Definition:**
   - `neuralnet.py`: This script defines the neural network architecture used in the federated learning setup.

    ```bash
    python neuralnet.py
    ```

## Evaluation

After running the attacks, you can evaluate the results by analyzing performance metrics and graphical outputs generated by the scripts.
